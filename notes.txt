ISSUE: Chargemasters:

after creating the chargemasters_sheets table:

mysql> update chargemasters_sheets set sheet_type = 'Common25' where sheet_type is NULL
       and (name like '%AB 1045%' or name like '%Common%');

mysql> update chargemasters_sheets set sheet_type = 'PCT CHG' where sheet_type is NULL and name like '%PCT CH%';

QUESTION: We have the pcs_quarterly_received_claims table, which keeps track of complaints against a provider. Where
else is the provider used? Is it connected to facilities?

what is this file really doing?
