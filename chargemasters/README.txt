We have a file like: 2023/2023 Completed Reviews/Canyon Ridge Hospital/106364050_CDM_ALL_2023.xls

has data:

#	Service Code	Description	CPT Code	PRICE
1	916100-1	ADULT PSYCH GROUP THERAP	90853	 240.00 
2	916101-9	ADULT PSYCH GRP THERAPY	90853	 240.00 
3	916102-7	ADULT ACTIVITY THERAPY	G0176	 150.00 

Right now, I am expecting the CPT Code in column B. Here, CPT Code is in column D.

I need to locate the "CPT Code" label, and then look to the column before and after it,
no matter where it is.

Ultimately, this will still have problems if the columns are not in the correct order.

But can I rely on column names?
