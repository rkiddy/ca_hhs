I am receiving notifications when the data set changes. There is no detail but one can re-download the data,

from the site:

Facility data were obtained from the CDPH’s Electronic Licensing Management System (ELMS) database.
ELMS records health facility/provider applications, issues licenses, generates license renewal
notices, determines license fees, issues and tracks state enforcement actions, and generates
management reports. Facility licensing applications are entered into ELMS by L&C District Office staff.
Refer to L&C's webpage for the application forms needed to apply for a healthcare facility license:
https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/LCP/Pages/ApplyForLicensure.aspx. Contact L&C District Offices
to initiate a license or update facility information:

<summary>hospital-building-data</summary>

Contains construction information for the buildings, includes number of stories, and building code in effect
when built. Includes a "perm_id" assigned as "Facility number per Facilities Development Division". Will this
match up with the "facid" fields in other datasets? We will see.
