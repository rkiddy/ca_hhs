Some have the MergedCell problem with column_letter.

What a pain in the rear. I have to manually construct a tables structure because the spreadsheets have
data starting at a different place, in row 6 and not row 1. And they start in column B.

And the earlier versions start in a different different place. They start in row 5 and column A. Because.

There is going to be a better way to figure this out....
