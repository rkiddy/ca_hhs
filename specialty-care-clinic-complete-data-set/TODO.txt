These two datasets are really two parts of one:

	specialty-care-clinic-complete-data-set
	pre-2012-specialty-care-clinic-utilization-data

These xlsx files have some complications. There are two types and they
have different start column values and different start row values.

Also, they have the MergedCell problem also.
